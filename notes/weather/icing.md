# Icing

## Icing Locations

Icing happens first on small or narrow aircraft components, such as antennas.

Icing will happen on the tailplane before the wings, because of the smaller surface area.

## Types of Ice

### Structural Icing

Icing that accumulates on the exterior of the aircraft

### Induction Icing

Icing that accumulates in the engine's induction system

**Carburetor Icing**
