# Air Masses

**Air Mass** - a large body of air with generally uniform temperature and humidity

**Source Origin** - an area from which an air mass originates

The longer an air mass stagnates over its source region, the more likely it is to aquire the properties of the surface below.

Air masses are classified by **temperature properties** and **moisture properties**.

### Temperature Properties
- Arctic (A) deep and cold, develops over winter artic areas
- Polar (P) shallow and cool to cold, develops over high latitudes
- Tropical (T) warm to hot, develops over low latitudes

### Moisture Properties
- Continental (c) dry, develops over land
- Maritime (m) moist, develops over water

### Resulting 5 Air Masses
1. Continental Arctic (cA) cold, dry
2. Continental Polar (cP) cool, dry
3. Continental Tropical (cT) hot, dry
4. Maritime Polar (mP) cool, moist
5. Maritime Tropical (mT) warm, moist

Maritime Arctic is considered NA because it rarely forms.
