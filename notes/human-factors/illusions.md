## Spatial Disorientation Illusions

ICEFLAGGS

- inversion
- coriolis
- elevator
- false horizon
- leans
- autokinesis
- graveyard spin
- graveyard spiral
- somatogravic

### Inversion

**Cause** - an abrupt change from climb to straight and level

**Illusion** - feeling of tumbling backwards

**Result** - pitch down

### Coriolis

**Cause** - abrupt head movements in a prolonged constant-rate turn

**Illusion** - feeling of rotation on a different axis

**Result** - dangerous attitude

### Elevator

**Cause** - abrupt upward vertical acceleration

**Illusion** - feeling of a climb

**Result** - pitch down

### False Horizon

**Cause** - poor visibility, clouds, ground lights, stars, etc.

**Illusion** - aircraft will appear misaligned with horizon

**Result** - dangerous attitude

### Leans

**Cause** - enter bank slowly, abrupt correction

**Illusion** - feeling of banking in the opposite direction

**Result** - return to original dangerous bank, or pilot will lean

### Autokinesis

**Cause** - staring at a light in the dark

**Illusion** - light appears to move

**Result** - attempt to align aircraft with the light

### Graveyard Spin

**Cause** - proper recovery from a spin

**Illusion** - feeling of spinning in the opposite direction

**Result** - return to original spin

### Graveyard Spiral

**Cause** - loss of altitude during a prolonged turn

**Illusion** - feeling of being in a wings-level descent

**Result** - pitch up, tightening the turn, increasing the loss of altitude

### Somatogravic

**Cause** - rapid acceleration or deceleration

**Illusion** - nose up or nose down attitude, respectively

**Result** - pitch down or pitch up, respectively

## Landing Error Illusions

### Runway Width Illusions

- **Narrower** - looks higher, pilot might fly lower
- **Wider** - looks lower, pilot might fly higher 

### Sloping Runway or Terrain Illusions

- **Upsloping** - looks higher, pilot might fly lower
- **Downsloping** - looks lower, pilot might fly higher 

### Featureless Terrain Illusion

looks higher, pilot might fly lower

### Atmospheric Illusions

- **Rain** - looks higher, pilot might fly lower
- **Haze** - looks farther, pilot might fly lower
- **Penetrating Fog** - looks like a pitch up, pilot might steepen the approach

### Ground Lighting Illusions

- **Aligned Ground Lights** - such as a street or train, might be mistaken for approach lighting systems
- **Bright Approach Lighting Systems** - especially with few surrounding lights, look closer, pilot might fly higher
