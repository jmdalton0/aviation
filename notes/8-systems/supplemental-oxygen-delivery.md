# Supplemental Oxygen Delivery Systems

[Oxygen Equipment Brochure](https://www.faa.gov/pilots/safety/pilotsafetybrochures/media/oxygen_equipment.pdf)

## Continuous Flow

- continuous flow of oxygen 
- wasteful
- come included in many turbocharged aircraft

### Nasal Cannula

- rests under the nose
- restricted to below 18,000 ft

### Rebreather

- includes a bag that collects exhailed air
- restricted to below 25,000 ft

## Diluter Demand

- usually required to be a quick-don mask
- sealed to your face
- provides oxygen during inhalation, stops flow during exhalation
- dilutes incoming oxygen with cabin air
- provides proper percentage of oxygen, depending on altitude
- conserves oxygen
- restricted to below 40,000 ft

## Pressure Demand

- provides positive pressure oxygen that slightly over-inflates the lungs
- used when 100% oxygen without positive pressure is insufficient at very high pressure altitudes
