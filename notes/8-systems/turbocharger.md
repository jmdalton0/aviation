# Turbocharger 

[PHAK 7]()

**Turbocharger** - device that increases the power output of an engine by compressing air before it enters the cylinders

## Operation

- **exhaust gases** rotate a turbine, which drives an **air compressor**
- air enters the intake valve and is compressed
- compressed air enters the intake manifold where it mixes with fuel before entering the cylinders
- a **waste gate** controls how much exhaust is used to drive the turbine
- **automatic waste gates** are often controlled by engine oil pressure

## Comparison to Superchargers

Turbochargers are preferred over superchargers because of their efficiency.

### Pros

- benefit from waste energy in exhaust gases, making them more fuel efficient
- less moving parts
- lighter than superchargers

### Cons

- ineffective at low RPMs
- lag between throttle increase and exhaust output
- higher temperatures
- more expensive
