# Pilot Qualifications - Instrument

## Instrument Rating Requirements

[61.65]() | [141 App C]() | [Syllabus]()

- PPL
- English
- 30 hrs ground 
- 35 hrs flight
    + up to 40% can be in an AATD
- 1 cross country
    + 250 nm total
    + 100 nm straight line distance between at least 2 airports
    + 3 approaches, at least 1 at each airport

## Instrument Currency

[61.57]()

### To act as PIC under IFR or in IMC

Within the last 6 months, perform **6HITS**

- 6 approaches
- holds
- intercepting and tracking courses using nav systems

These procedures

- can be simulated
- do not require an instructor

If not completed within the last 6 months, a pilot has an additional 6 months to reestablish currency.

If not completed within the total 12 months, an **Instrument Proficiency Check** is required.

- performed by DPE, CFII, etc.

### Simulated IFR

[61.57]()

For the purposes of training and currency, IFR can be simulated using

- aircraft with a view-limiting device and safety pilot
- FFS, FTD, ATD

[91.109]()

A safety pilot must have

- PPL with appropriate category and class ratings
- vision forward and to each side of the aircraft
- dual controls

## Instrument Recordkeeping

### Logging Instrument Time

[61.51]()

Instrument time can be logged if

- the pilot operates the aircraft solely by reference to instruments under actual or simulated IFR

Instrument flight logbook entries must include

- simulated instrument time
- actual instrument time

Instrument flight logbook entries that count towards currency must include

- safety pilot name
- location and type of instrument approaches
- (if in a sim) device, time, and content

In order to log an approach

- the FIF must be crossed
- if in VMC, the approach must be flown to minimums
